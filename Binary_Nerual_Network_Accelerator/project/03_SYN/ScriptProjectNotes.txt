Two scripts are provided to run in order.

You might need to, or choose to, modify the scripts or how you use DC as follows:

1. Change modname to the name of the top Verilog module in your design - see the beginning of script 1

2. Uncomment ungroup -flatten -all if you are having hiearachy problems

3. If you want to implement pipeline retiming, see the comments before compile_ultra in script 1

4. If you want to squeeze down the clock period, look at the instructions in HW 3.  Do those steps at the end of script 1.

5. Problems reported after the read command in script 1 generally need to be fixed, including LINT warnings.

6. Problems reported by check_design BEFORE the compile_ultra (script 1) can often be ignored, but fix anything obvious

7. Problems reported by check_design AFTER the compile_ultra (script 2) can generally NOT be ignored
